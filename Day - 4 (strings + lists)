explaination:   declared a string and named it as str
                assigned a string to it i.e sud!ksh@
                declared a variable and created an empty list and named it as list1
                using a for loopo iterated each character in the str
                using if not in condition checked if the special char or vowel is present in the string if yes then do not add it to the empty list1
                if not then add that element to the lsit1 list 
                peinted list1
                hence, converted a string into a list and removed all the special characters and vowels '''

'''
explaination:   declared a variable and named it as lsit0 created a list to store the characters anakapally
                declared another empty string andd named it as str0
                using a forloop iterated each element in the list
                checked f the element is repeated or not if repeated it will be replaced with '-'
                if not then the iterated element will be added into the empty sting wihtout replacing
                print the string 
                therefore the string list is converted into a string skipping all the duplicates and replaced with '-'
