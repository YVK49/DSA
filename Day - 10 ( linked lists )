linked lists:
  its a linear data structure and its is a replacments of list/arrays in python 
how do they work
  basically it is the combination of nodes where in each node contain the data and the memory location of the data present in the next node 
  the first node of a linked list is said to be {HEAD}
  the last node of a linked list is said to be {TAIL}
  in simple terms ( consider each node as an object which contains items in them )
why linked list is better than an array:
  1) in an array if there are n items and want to delete an element its time complexity is 0(n) but if there is a linked list and we had to perform an operation then the time complexity is 0(1) where constant growth of order is more efficient than the linear growth of order 
  2) the issue of time complexity is solved by using a linked list
  3) different data structures can be derived using linked lists
  4) for write operations the time complexity is better than array but where as in read operations the time complexity of a linked list is not as good as the time complexity of a an array
