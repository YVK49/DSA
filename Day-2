explaination: for removing duplicates****
                declared a list and named it as list6
                created an other empty list and named it as d_list
                using a for loop iterated every element in the list6 as o
                given a condition that if the iterated element from list6 is not present in d_list then add the iterated element to d_list
                printed d_list
                hence, all the duplicates are removed as the loop continues till the n-1th index of list6 the element which is already existede in d_list it is ignored by the interpreter
                therefore the duplicates are removed
              for finding the unique element
                decalred a list and named it as list6
                declared a variable named u_list and initialzied it with 0
                using a for loop iterated every element in the list6 as o
                given a condition to count each element in the list6 i.e o and if the count is eqal to 1 than that particular element is added to the varibale u_list
                printed u_list which gives the element whose count is 1
                hence, the unique number is printed '''
