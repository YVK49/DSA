what are data structures ? 
  data structures are ways to store and organize the data 
  there are certain difficulties in computer science which are very hard to solve. we use data structures to solve them efficiently which helps in saving time and space complexity

                          |--linear data structures ------------------------|
                          |                                                 |--arrays --------|
                          |                                                                   |--referncial arrays ( call by refence arryas) -	Function gets access to original array
                          |                                                                   |-- call by value arrays - functions gets access to a duplicate array where there will be no change in the original array
                          |                                                 |--linked-lists
                          |                                                 |--queues
                          |                                                 |--stacks

                          |
                          |

                          |                                     |--graphs
                          |                                     |--trees

Arrays :
  a data structure used to store multiple items of same data type in a continuus memory location
  ex:- storing a adhar numbers of each a city
       list of contact numbers
  Disadvantages of arrays:
    1) homogenous (it is solved by using the call by reference technique) 
    2) fixed size ( it can be solved by dynamic arrays )
  what is dynamic array:
    an array whos size can adjusted when we add or delete elements in the array (in python list is a dynamic array and the list is called by reference so there is no wastage of memory and problem with hommogenous data types storage )
    in simple terms 
      *its size is resizable 
      *its memory grows dynamically 
      *slightly slower than the static array when the size of the array is adjusted i.e resized
