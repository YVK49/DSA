Here's a DSA Weekly Study Plan (8 Weeks) ‚Äî designed to give you a solid foundation with Python. You‚Äôll learn the most important concepts, implement code, and practice problems every week.

üóìÔ∏è 8-Week DSA Study Plan Using Python

Daily Time Commitment: 1‚Äì2 hours
Ideal Platforms: LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, NeetCode, Python Tutor, Visualgo

‚úÖ Week 1: Arrays & Strings
Concepts:

Arrays, Lists in Python
String manipulation
Sliding Window, Two pointers
Practice:

Reverse array
Move zeroes to end
Kadane‚Äôs algorithm
Longest substring without repeating characters
Resources: LeetCode Easy Arrays, NeetCode Patterns

‚úÖ Week 2: Hash Tables (Maps, Sets)
Concepts:

Hashing basics
Frequency counter
Hash collisions & sets
Practice:

Two Sum
Group Anagrams
Top K Frequent Elements
Valid Anagram
Python tools: dict, collections.Counter, set

‚úÖ Week 3: Stacks & Queues
Concepts:

LIFO vs FIFO
Stack via list/deque
Queue via deque
Monotonic stack basics
Practice:

Valid Parentheses
Min Stack
Daily Temperatures
Next Greater Element
Libraries: collections.deque, queue

‚úÖ Week 4: Linked Lists
Concepts:

Singly & Doubly Linked Lists
Slow & fast pointer
Reversal, cycle detection
Practice:

Reverse Linked List
Detect Cycle
Merge Two Sorted Lists
Remove Nth Node from End
Tip: Implement linked list class manually once

‚úÖ Week 5: Recursion & Binary Search
Concepts:

Recursion tree, base & recursive cases
Binary Search (standard, left/right bias)
Recursion vs Iteration
Practice:

Fibonacci (recursive & DP)
Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Kth element in sorted array
Subsets / Power Set
Use pythontutor.com to visualize recursion

‚úÖ Week 6: Trees & Binary Search Trees
Concepts:

Tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder)
BST properties
Height, depth, LCA
Practice:

Invert Binary Tree
Max Depth of Tree
Validate BST
Lowest Common Ancestor
Tip: Visualize trees on Visualgo

‚úÖ Week 7: Heaps & Graphs
Concepts:

Min/Max Heaps (heapq)
Priority Queues
Graphs: BFS, DFS, adjacency list
Practice:

Kth Largest Element
Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm
Clone Graph
Number of Islands (DFS + BFS)

‚úÖ Week 8: Dynamic Programming (Intro)
Concepts:

Memoization vs Tabulation
State definition & transition
Subproblems
Practice:

Climbing Stairs (DP)
House Robber
Longest Increasing Subsequence
0/1 Knapsack
Focus on small problems ‚Äî don‚Äôt rush to hard DP early on.

üéØ Final Tips
Solve at least 3‚Äì5 problems per topic (start easy ‚Üí medium)
Read others‚Äô solutions to learn new techniques
Maintain a GitHub repo of your DSA solutions (for review + resume)
Use spaced repetition for hard concepts
