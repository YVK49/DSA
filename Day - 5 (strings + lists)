explaination:   declared a variable and created a list of words and named the variable as list
                declared another variable and named it as capitalized 
                capitalized each word in the list by iterating each word in the list using capitalize() method
                declared another variable as result and using join() method joined ', ' to the end of each word 
                printed result 
                therefore joined a list of words into sentence with capitalized words and commas

explaination:   declare a variable and named it as propose 
                assigned a sentence "i love you"
                using the split() method splitted the words in the sentence and stroed it in a variable words
                using a for loop and negative slicing we have reversed the words and stored the reversed word in that variable
                by using join() method we have joined a blacnk space in between each and every word and stroed it a variable called final_sentence
                printed the final final_sentence
                therefore, each word in the sentence has been reversed
